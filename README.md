# Live-News-Web-Page
I've created this web page tah consumes an news API making a online magazine that can refresh the news, create new news blocks and organize and bring them by topic.

## !_Keys

```csharp
// Default
string apiKey = "d985a0f646bb46a4ac8b0140b432371e";

// Created 30/07
string apiKey2 = "f2b66cc557b2481db797989471d84d10";
```

## !_Please Attention
This app was made using an free API, that means that the call made in this APP were using the Live Server extension on Visual Studio, so the response of the API 
dont turn out to be  other than statusCode == 200.

Calling this api outside an localhost will result in error in case of the plan that created the key in not a premium type.
